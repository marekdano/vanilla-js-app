    <h1>CSS Variables</h1>
    <p class="first">
        Custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables) are entities defined by CSS authors
        that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document.
    </p>
    <p class="second">
        Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS, often with a lot of repeated values. For example, the same color might
        be used in hundreds of different places, requiring global search and replace if that color needs to change. Custom
        properties allow a value to be stored in one place, then referenced in multiple other places. An additional benefit is
        semantic identifiers. For example, --main-text-color is easier to understand than #00ff00, especially if this same color
        is also used in other contexts.
